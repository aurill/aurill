<div align = "center"><h2>An Aspiring Data Scientist and FINTECH Professional<h2></div>

**- üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on a [Starbucks Chatbot Web Application](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64LHlNL-w3o) named Medussa by leveraging Machine Learning skills and Natural Language Processing techniques like tokenization and stemming to develop the Feed Forward Neural Network FrameWork as well as using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python‚Äôs Flask API Application to design the Front-end User Interface design.**

**- ‚öíÔ∏è I have created a [Starbucks E-commerce Website](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoFOY9T3spA) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Incorporated Stripe API for the Cart Checkout process and used Node.js for the server-side aspect of the website. Used sophisticated, detailed prompts (Prompt Engineering) to design the bulk of the product images showcased throughout the website using DALLE -3 image-generating software.**

**- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning how to build on my skills in developing a Feed Forward Neural network to develop a project using a Convolutional Neural Network Framework. Considering doing an image classification project or a Recommender System. Stay Tuned for that project that is to come.**


**This is a list of Tools, Software, and Applications that I have used over the course of my Professional and Personal Journey.**
